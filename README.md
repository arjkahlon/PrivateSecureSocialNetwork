HourGlass- Senior Design Project

Project Partners: Arjun Kahlon, Jiss Xavier, Richmond Ballesteros, and Shaivya Padia

We have been working together to create a new private and secure social media platform, HourGlass, where users can post content that has a variable lifespan. When a user uploads an image to our platform that post is assigned a default life span of 24 hours. This lifespan can be increased by other users on the platform by engaging with that piece of content. More specifically, users have the ability to ‘boost’ content causing an increase in the lifespan of posts on our platform. Therefore, the persisting content on our platform will be the ones most frequently engaged with by our users. The proprietary feature of our social media platform is the concept of a lifespan attached to the content posted. We decided to add this concept of a life span to posts as a means of ensuring fresh and popular content on our platform allowing us to stand out from existing similar platforms. All of the content on our website will be presented through a modern, sleek, and user friendly interface that closely resembles the grid-like format found on the application page of the Apple Watch.
